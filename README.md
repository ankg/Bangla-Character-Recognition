# Bangla-Character-Recognition
Visual patterns recognition system which can recognise Hand-written Bangla characters using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. This model achieved a top-1 prediction accuracy of 91.1 % which far surpassed the former recorded accuracy of 87.2 % in this project. This was developed in Theano, a python library specializes for Deep Learning Architectures.This project was a part of the Machine Learning course in the curriculum of the Computer Science department of IIT Roorkee.
